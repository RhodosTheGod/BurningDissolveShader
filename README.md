# Burning Dissolve Shader	
This project is based on [PolyTuts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGQVeHxXnvjFlU-bnrVv-OA)' [Burning Dissolve Shader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Oh69O7TYo) tutorial series. In original series, PolyToots is using [Amplify Shader Editor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/amplify-shader-editor-68570) plugin,  so I decided to remake it in ShaderLab. Since shader is created as an surface shader, it only supports built-in render pipeline.
